# Simple-node.js-logger
A little project i made for fun!



# How to use

1st do npm install colors

Example:
```
const logger = require("./logger.js");

logger("info", "Hello"); "info" can be replaced with "warning", "error", "log" and "success"
```
It can also take a third argument which will display in magenta color.
